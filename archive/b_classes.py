# Beginner's Python
# Cheat Sheet - Classes
# What are classes?
# Classes are the foundation of object-oriented
# programming. Classes represent real-world things
# you want to model in your programs: for example
# dogs, cars, and robots. You use a class to make
# objects, which are specific instances of dogs, cars,
# and robots. A class defines the general behavior that
# a whole category of objects can have, and the
# information that can be associated with those objects.
# Classes can inherit from each other â€“ you can
# write a class that extends the functionality of an
# existing class. This allows you to code efficiently for a
# wide variety of situations.
